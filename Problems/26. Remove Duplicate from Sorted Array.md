# Python
## Time Complexity
- Best, worst, and expected cases describe the big 0 (or big theta) time for particular inputs or scenarios. Big 0, big omega, and big theta describe the upper, lower, and tight bounds for the runtime
- **what is Big 0, big omega, and big theta?**
- **How to calculate time complexity? How to calculate space complexity?**
- **What is Big O Notation?**

#### Example
```
public int findMax(int[] arr) {
    int max = arr[0]; // O(1)
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) { // O(n)
        if (arr[i] > max) { // O(1) inside the loop
            max = arr[i]; // O(1) inside the loop
        }
    }
    return max; // O(1)
}
```
Basic operations: Assignments and comparisons within the loop.  
Time complexity: In this case, the loop runs n times (where n is the size of the input array), leading to a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case.  
Space complexity: The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space (for variables like max, i), so the space complexity is O(1).
