# Python
## Time and Space Complexity
- Best, worst, and expected cases describe the big 0 (or big theta) time for particular inputs or scenarios. Big 0, big omega, and big theta describe the upper, lower, and tight bounds for the runtime
- **what is Big 0, big omega, and big theta?**
- **How to calculate time complexity? How to calculate space complexity?**
- **What is Big O Notation?**

#### Example
```
public int findMax(int[] arr) {
    int max = arr[0]; // O(1)
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) { // O(n)
        if (arr[i] > max) { // O(1) inside the loop
            max = arr[i]; // O(1) inside the loop
        }
    }
    return max; // O(1)
}
```
Basic operations: Assignments and comparisons within the loop.  
Time complexity: In this case, the loop runs n times (where n is the size of the input array), leading to a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case.  
Space complexity: The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space (for variables like max, i), so the space complexity is O(1).  

## Ideas about No.26
1. two pointers: L,R
- L-->K, R-->move& compare with the former one
2. if not equal, insert; if equal, pass+1
3. return L=K
```
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        L=1
        for R in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[R] != nums[R-1]:
                nums[L]=nums[R]
                L +=1
        return L
```
