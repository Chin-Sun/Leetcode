### Ideas 
```
class Solution(object):
  def removeDuplicates(self, nums:List[int]):
    L,R = 0,0

    while R < len(nums):
      count =1
      while R+1<len(nums) and nums[R]=nums[R+1]:
        count +=1
        R +=1

      for i in range(min(count,2)):
        nums[L]=nums[R]
        L +=1
      R += 1
    return L  
```
### Better Solution
```
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        ind = 2  # Pointer from where we need to replace elements
        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            if nums[i]!=nums[ind-2]:
                nums[ind] = nums[i]
                ind+=1
        return ind

```

### Faster Solution (11ms)
**Why is this solution so fast? Dose boolen have an impact on the speed?**
```
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        k = 1
        Repeat=True

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i]!=nums[i-1]:
                nums[k] = nums[i]
                k=k+1
                Repeat=True
            else:
                if Repeat:
                    nums[k]=nums[i]
                    k=k+1
                    Repeat=False
        return k
```
The role of the Repeat boolean variable is to control whether to include the current duplicate element in the result. When encountering a duplicate, the code checks if Repeat is True. If it is, the code includes the duplicate element in the result (by copying it to the new position), increments the count k, and then sets Repeat to False to skip subsequent duplicates of the same element. This allows the algorithm to consider only the first occurrence of duplicates.  

Regarding the impact of the boolean variable (Repeat) on speed:  
- The boolean variable itself might not directly impact the speed significantly. However, its role in controlling the inclusion of duplicate elements effectively reduces the number of operations performed in the loop.  
- By selectively copying only the first occurrence of each duplicate element and skipping subsequent occurrences, it potentially reduces unnecessary assignments, thus improving the overall efficiency and speed of the algorithm.
