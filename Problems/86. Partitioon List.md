# Python
this problem can create a new list but still in the same order as head.  
time O(n), space/memory O(1) 

- left, right as **dummy/sentinel node** (sentinel node always points to the first node)
- ltail, rtail as move pointers

```
class Solution(object):
  def partition(self, head, x):
    left, right = ListNode(), ListNode()
    ltail, rtail = left, right

    while head:
      if head.val < x:
        ltail.next = head
        ltail = ltail.next
      else:
        rtail.next = head
        rtail = rtail.next
      head = head.next
    rtail.next = None
    ltail.next = right.next
    return left.next
```
- use **ltail.next = head** **instead of** *ltail.next = head.val*. there is an attribute type of error.
- use rtail.next = None, so the final node can be null instead of a number.
