# Python
## Idea:
- nums1 should have the length of m+n-1.  
- for space complexity, the bigger one should be merged into the last space in num1
- for a special condition, such as num1[0]>num2[0], we should use a new while to merge the num2[0] into num1[0].
```
class Solution(object):
  def merge(self, num1, m, num2, n):
    # for step1
    last = m+n-1

    # for step2
    while m>0, n>0:
      if num1[m-1] > num2[n-1]:
        num1[last] = num1[m-1]
        m-=1
      else
        num1[last] = num2[n-1]
        n-=1
      last-=1

    # for speccial condtion, such as num1[0]=2, num2[0]=1
    while n>0:
      num1[last]=num2[n-1]
      n, last = n-1, last-1   
```

#### What is Array?
It is a collection of elements or items stored at contiguous memory locations, each identified by an index or key.

#### What is time complexity? What is space complexity? How to reduce both of them?
- Time complexity: It measures how the execution time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input.
- Space complexity: It measures the maximum amount of memory needed by an algorithm during its execution.
