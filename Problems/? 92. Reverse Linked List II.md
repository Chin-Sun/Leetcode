连看两遍答案解析都看不懂QAQ  
- It is more likely to be relate to the DLList. And you need to use .last and .prev to solve this problem.  
- The lecture is week 2.3 in CS61B

```
class Solution(object):
    def reverseBetween(self, head, left, right):
        dummy = ListNode(0,head)

        LeftPrev, cur = dummy, dummy.next

        for i in range(left-1):
            cur=cur.next
            LeftPrev = LeftPrev.next

        prev = cur
        cur = cur.next
        for i in range (right-left):
            temp = cur
            cur = temp.next
            temp.next = prev
            prev = temp
            

        LeftPrev.next.next = cur
        LeftPrev.next = prev

        return dummy.next
  ```
- In standard answer, they use **prev=None** and **range ( right-left+1 )**, which is different with me.
- Maybe my answer can be improved
